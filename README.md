#  Ruby - Tic Tac Toe 

> This is my own implementation of the Tic-tac-toe game. I had to build an interactive Tic-tac-toe game in Ruby where two players are required to play against each other on the terminal. This game is user-friendly and interactive. For more information on the tic-tac-toe game, you can read it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe">here.</a>
